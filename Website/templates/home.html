<h2> General donkey kong game play </h2>

<p class="pop">In Super Smash Bros. Ultimate, Donkey Kong is a heavy brawler who relies on powerful grabs, platform setups, and devastating kill confirms. His signature playstyle in Ultimate often revolves around the Pdko (Platform Donkey Kong Knock-out), where he uses cargo up throw into up air on platforms to secure early kills—sometimes stocks can vanish at surprisingly low percents if the stage layout is favorable. Beyond this, DK has excellent range on his tilts and aerials, with back air being his best spacing and edgeguard tool, while down tilt and neutral air help him control neutral and break combos. He hits extremely hard and can pressure shields with charged Giant Punch or down special, but he’s also very large, easy to juggle, and his recovery is predictable if opponents know how to punish it. The key to playing DK in Ultimate is to stay patient, rack up damage with grabs and safe aerials, and then convert into P.D.K.O. kills or back air edgeguards once your opponent is at the right percentage. On stages with platforms, he becomes especially dangerous, so a smart DK will use stage positioning to maximize his cargo throw threat while avoiding being overwhelmed by faster characters. </p>

<h2> What stages to pick </h2>

<p> In Super Smash Bros. Ultimate, Donkey Kong’s best stages are those with strong platform layouts that amplify his Pdko  kill setups. Battlefield is often considered his best pick since its triple platforms allow him to convert cargo up throw into up air kills at surprisingly low percentages, while also giving him more landing options against juggle-heavy characters. Pokémon Stadium 2 is another excellent choice, offering wide space for survivability and perfectly placed side platforms that support P.D.K.O. confirms without feeling cramped. Town & City benefits DK with close side blast zones for earlier back air and forward throw kills, along with moving platforms that provide creative grab combos and mix-ups. Smashville is also strong because its single central platform guarantees consistent cargo throw setups and forces opponents into DK’s grab range. Yoshi’s Story works similarly to Battlefield with a tri-platform layout, but its smaller blast zones let DK secure stocks even earlier. On the flip side, stages like Final Destination limit him heavily since the lack of platforms removes his best kill setups and makes him easy to juggle, while stages like Kalos and Lylat are inconsistent for his platform confirms and can hinder his movement or recovery. Overall, Donkey Kong thrives on platform-heavy stages where his P.D.K.O. is a constant threat. </p>

<h2> What donkey kong struggles against </h2>

<p> Donkey Kong in Smash Ultimate struggles the most against fast, combo-heavy characters with disjointed hitboxes that can overwhelm his slower frame data and exploit his large hurtbox. Rushdown fighters like Fox or Pikachu can weave in and out of his range, stringing together long combos while giving him little room to breathe, and swordfighters such as Lucina or Cloud can safely wall him out with long-reaching aerials that out-prioritize his own. Zoners also give DK a hard time, as characters like Samus or Mega Man can pelt him with projectiles, forcing him to approach where his big body makes him an easy target. In general, DK struggles when opponents can juggle him repeatedly, pressure his shield safely, or exploit his predictable recovery, since he lacks fast options to escape disadvantage. </p>

<h2> Over view </h2>

<p> Over all if you want a character that struggles to find openings, gets destroyed half the match, is hit by almost anything but can kill the other player in one good hit then donkey kong is the character for you. This mid tier makes you feel powerfull when you are winning and hopless when you are lossing.</p>
